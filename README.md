## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Python** to interact with an **SQL database** for data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis. It shows how to:

- Connect Python to a database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- Execute SQL queries from Python
- Fetch and process data using Python tools like pandas
- Analyze or visualize results (if included)

Using Python and SQL together is a common practice in data analytics, data engineering, and backend development roles.
