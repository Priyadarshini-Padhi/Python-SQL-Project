##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Python** to interact with an **SQL database** for data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis. It shows how to:

- Connect Python to a database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- Execute SQL queries from Python
- Fetch and process data using Python tools like pandas
- Analyze or visualize results (if included)

Using Python and SQL together is a common practice in data analytics, data engineering, and backend development roles.

##  Topics Covered

In this project you will learn:

1. **Database Connection with Python**  
   - Establishing connection to a database from Python code.  

2. **Executing SQL Queries in Python**  
   - Running SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries using Python interfaces.

3. **Data Retrieval & Processing**  
   - Fetching results from SQL and manipulating them in Python (e.g., with pandas).

4. **Basic Data Analysis (Optional)**  
   - Performing simple analysis or summarization on fetched data.

5. **Integrating Python & SQL for Automation**  
   - Automating database tasks using Python scripts or notebooks.
